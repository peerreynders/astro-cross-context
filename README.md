# astro-cross-context

This demo has four separate React islands accessing the same central application (the obligatory counter) via their own contexts.

- [`createApp()`](./src/app/create-app.ts) creates the application around a [nanostore](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) [atom](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores#user-content-atoms).
- [`island-context`](./src/components/island-context.ts) manages app and context creation (In reality each island would likely be it's own context with an entirely distinct global name. Here the islands are instances of the same componentâ€”so the contexts are managed by one global [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)).
* [`CounterUI`](./src/components/CounterUI.tsx) is the "Control Panel" for the application. The [`useApp()`](./src/components/use-app.ts) hook gives the component access to the application.
* [`Island`](./src/components/Island.tsx) is the component tree for a single island.

The index page shows four identical UIs, each one bound to the same application.
